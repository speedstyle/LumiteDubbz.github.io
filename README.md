<p>SauceBot is a primarily administrative Discord bot, made with Discord.js. It is designed to function similarly to the DEA Discord bot. Many of the servers in my community are Bloons TD Battles servers, and the DEA bot was made by an ex-YouTuber of that game, so people will know how to use the bot before they've even tried it out.</p>
